This is an interesting hack an slash style game that I recently tried out and highly recommend. If you like Diablo 2 (or Path of Exile) and enjoy Viking culture in general this is the game for you! It add some interesting mechanics and is an intriguing take on the genre. I got a link at the bottom to get the game from G2A at 94% off, check it out!
